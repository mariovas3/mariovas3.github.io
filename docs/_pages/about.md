## Brief Summary:
I am currently a *Computer Vision Research Engineer* at [Zebra Technologies](https://www.zebra.com/gb/en.html) in London, UK. My main achievements are - improving model predictive performance, actively contributing to and maintaining our internal core repository, and greatly **reducing the latency** across the company's models when deployed on **edge devices** with **NPUs**. So far, my contributions on improving predictive performance and latency of vision models have been algorithmic and have affected all models in our business unit, thus making them high impact contributions.

I graduated from MSc Machine Learning at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). With experience and interests in *Reinforcement Learning* and *Generative Models*. I have also completed courseworks related to *NLP* (GAN-BERT for semi-supervised learning) and *Computer Vision* (VAE, Neural Style Transfer).

Before this I was working as an Applied Scientist at [NewDay](https://www.newday.co.uk/), where I applied Deep Learning (Natural Language Processing) for text augmentation and sentiment analysis. I also worked on improving the performance of an incumbent chatbot model. Other projects I worked on include building a churn prediction model and marketing channel analysis using Bayesian models.

I did my bachelor's degree - BSc Statistics, Economics and Finance (accredited by the [Royal Statistical Society](https://rss.org.uk/)) - at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk).

## Career interests:
So far my contributions have been general and high impact, I am flexible when it comes to optimising predictive and speed performance of models of different modalities. My interests lie in Research Engineering, therefore. See my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z1Jg2k6Ih9tZZ6GpHji2WlV1SxD8XlyC/view?usp=sharing) for more information.
