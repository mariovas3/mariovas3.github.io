## Brief Summary:
Currently a student of MSc Machine Learning at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). With interests in Reinforcement Learning, Inverse Reinforcement Learning and Generative Models.

Before this I was working as an Applied Scientist at [NewDay](https://www.newday.co.uk/), where I applied Deep Learning (Natural Language Processing) for text augmentation and iterated over different architectures to improve the performance of an incumbent chatbot model. Other projects I worked on, were associated with performing analytics for the business teams.

I did my bachelor's degree - BSc Statistics, Economics and Finance (accredited by the [Royal Statistical Society](https://rss.org.uk/)) - at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk).

## Career interests:
Thanks to the deeply technical skills acquired from my master's degree in Machine Learning, I am looking forward to working on the implementation and engineering of complex systems similar but not limited to the ones mentioned above. As such I will be more interested in an Engineering role than a pure Research one.
