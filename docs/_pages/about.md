## Brief Summary:
Graduate of MSc Machine Learning at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). With experience and interests in *Reinforcement Learning* and *Generative Models*. I have also completed courseworks and work experience with *NLP* (GAN-BERT for semi-supervised learning) and *Computer Vision* (VAE, Neural Style Transfer).

Before this I was working as an Applied Scientist at [NewDay](https://www.newday.co.uk/), where I applied Deep Learning (Natural Language Processing) for text augmentation and sentiment analysis. I also iterated over different architectures (CNN, LSTM, BERT) to improve the performance of an incumbent chatbot model. Other projects I worked on include building a churn prediction model and marketing channel analysis using Bayesian models.

I did my bachelor's degree - BSc Statistics, Economics and Finance (accredited by the [Royal Statistical Society](https://rss.org.uk/)) - at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk).

## Career interests:
Thanks to the deep technical skills acquired from my master's degree in Machine Learning, I am looking forward to working on the implementation and engineering of complex systems similar but not limited to the ones mentioned above (RL and NLP). As such I will be more interested in an Engineering role rather than a pure Research one.
